#Credit card fraud has become an increasing problem due to the growing reliance on electronic payment systems and technological advances.  This challenge affects stakeholders globally, from consumers and businesses to financial institutions. As the volume of digital transactions increases, so does the complexity of fraudulent tactics, necessitating the use of sophisticated analytical tools to detect and prevent such activities. Data analysis is crucial in this context, as it allows the examination of large datasets to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraud. By using the power of data analytics, it's possible to enhance the effectiveness of fraud detection systems, reduce financial losses, and bolster the security of credit card transactions. This project explores the nature of credit card fraud and aims to demonstrate how using data-driven methods can effectively address this escalating problem.
